    <h1>20 December 2023</h1>
    <p>honestly this day wasnt of the a good start, you were mad at me for something you did, something you would have left if i did it, you could have just apologised, but aight, the museumwasn nothing i thought it would be like, but it's always nice spending time with you no matter what we do, and it was cool seeing a fine work of art looking at paintings, you looked beautiful, we got to the reasturant but i know you feel like and i feel the same, but it was kinda disapointing, mustang sally, the food was okay at best, but still it tasted better because i was with you(it tased worse when i got home), guess everything really is better when youre with someone you love </p>
