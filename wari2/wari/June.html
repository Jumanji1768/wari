                    <p>Actually i dont remeber much about this month</p>
                    <p>But i do remeberthat i kept trying to see you and it wasnt working out, i wanna see you you said youre not gonna be able to, we make planns and something always got in the way</p>
                    <p>And the was this time where you disappered for like 2 week and you said you thought i would of moved on from you but no i waited for you for a whole two weeks, i am glad i did thou you are worth the wait (even thou you said you lost interest because we havent been talking and i thought you blocked me)</p>
                    
                    <h1>24th June 2023</h1>
                    <p>I think this is the first day you ever came over (correct me if im wrong), and i was so nervous, i didnt know what to wear and i didnt know what we were gonna do, and i know i probably didnt tell you this but you looked so beautiful, you were wearing a top that kinda looked like a laced bra and it was pink i think, youve actually never wore it again weird i would have like to see more of it, the way it pushes youre cherrys up they looked bigger not that im complaining about the size i love them the way they are, and i know you know i was starring at them even thou i wasnt trying to they just drew me in, did you wear it on purpose so that i would look at them?</p>
                    <p>That doesnt matter thou, what matters is that i told that i like you and you said you dont wanna date me (thats sad for real), you said you would rather be friends with benefits thats wild but it didnt matter since you know i would still be with you technically but i knew that i had you right where i wanted you you were just scared</p>
