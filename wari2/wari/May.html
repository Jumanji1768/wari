            <h1>May 10th 2023</h2>
            <p>the day we met, actually seems like a long time ago, it was around half past 3 when you came into my life and everyday i am thankfull that you sat next to me and that you started talking to me cause lord knows i wasnt gonna talk to you</p>
            <p>i know we dont remeber how i got your numbers i say you took my phone and gave me andyou say i asked for them i dont know whos right(probably you thou, maybe)</p>
            <p>but that doesnt matter because this is the day you changed my life and im thankfull for that</p>
    
            <h1>May 12th 2023</h2>
            <p>You probally dont remeberbut this is the day i asked you out to our first date, after you ignored my texts, why did you ignore them?</p>
            <p>Acting like you didnt know i am the love of your life, but still this is also the first day we ever called each other, you probaly didnt know it but i actually only called you because you ignored me</p>
            <p>Like why i thought we had a connection but no you mized me, wild, and i never thought you would agree to the date and i was so happy when you did, time i was broke as hell</p>
    
            <h1>May 16th 1023</h2>
            <p>This is the day of our first "date"(date is in quotes since someone didnt think it was a date, wild), and i still remeber you were wearing your pink sweats and pink hoodie, with your white sneakers, and your black beanie with beads</p>
            <p>this coincidently was the first time i saw your ass and i as like damn, that ass fine ma,</p>
            <p>i was so nervous cause ive never done that before and i didnt know what to talk, but talking to you felt natural you knoiw like ive known you for the longest time.</p>
            <p>Its crazy how our first ever date got interrupted because someone didnt think it was a date, and you said you dont see us going anywhere, crazy</p>
            <p>but look at us now, and you thought i was crazy when i said were gonna be together</p>
