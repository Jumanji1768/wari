            <h1>15th September 2023</h1>
            <p>442(i probably shouldn't have started this with that but it is what it is), where to start actually, maybe start with you moving because i sat next to you, how our date had to be canceled, but thats all in the past now so dont think im still mad about it when you read this, but yeah thats what happened and you didnt even talk to me that day, crazy.</p>
    
            <h1>16th September 2023</h1>
            <p>this is when the fight started, when you started to feel guilty about leaving you boyfriend, just to go sit if "school mates" like how dare you the blasphemy, and you like why were you the one that was crying that doesnt make sense, ypu also kept calling me and i just wanted a little space you know to think you know, but still its in the past im over it :), and i think it was we handled it properly</p>
    
            <h1>28th-29th September</h1>
            <p>You may not remeber but on this night it was the first time that you and i slept together for the first time, on a phone call that is, everytime we tried before it was loadshedding, one of us's phone is gonna die or whatever else reason, but this night it worked out, and it was nice going to sleep knowing that youre there even thou you were not physically there with me i really cant wait till the dayy i can share a bed with me i need a short yellow and adorable bed warmer waiting for me when i get you :/</p>
