                <h3>Interlude</h3>
                <p>We actually did a lot in this month, and this is also the month we went on our first "real" date</p>
        
                <h1>17th October 2023</h1>
                <p>On this day it was the first time we went to our spot, at the coffee shop and you ordered the chai latte, and i ordered mocha, you didnt wanna order worried bout my budget.</p>
                <p>But that is reason number 12 of why i love you, i love how thoughtfull you are, even when i wanna do something for you put my feelings first before you accept it, even when i tell you not to worry about it you do</p>
                <p>After the coffee you helped me do something ive always wanted to do, which was go to the museum, and this is actually my personal favourite out of all our dates so far, i really enjoyed just walking and talking to you, while we "learn" about animal and gemstones, the smile you had when we were there ill never forget it, in your black hoodie, blue jeans and white shoes</p>
                
                <h1>25th October 2023</h1>
                <p>The day of our picnic at the zoo, and i was so worried honestly, i wasnt comfortable with not paying, i did pay at the end thou i hope you put that picture somewhere safe.</p>
                <p>i know i told you that day, but you looked so beautiful, youre outfit, your hair, everything about you glowed,i would have proposed right there and then if i had a ring</p>
                <p>low-key i think we should have took that golf cart that basket was heavy, but i really enjoyed my day with you, i actually like it most when its just me and you laying down not doing anything, and just talking you know, cause i feel safe with you like the isnt anything to stress about cause im at home when im with you, so thank you for the day my love.</p>
                <p>And this is also the last time i saw you (wild)</p>
