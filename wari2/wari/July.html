        <h1>2nd July 2023</h1>
        <p>The day we started dating and you know what the craziest part about this, it's that you didnt tell me you liked me, i just said i like you and you said you dont know how you feel about me but you would like to see where this goes cause i really wasnt leaving you with much of a choice either im with you or nothing you know that (it looks like we got togetherover a call)</p>
        <p>But you didnt have to tell me anything i already knew you liked me :)</p>
        <p>P.S Honestly im happy that you did say yes and i hope you will say the same when its that time *cough**cough*</p>
    
        <h1>4th July 2023</h1>
        <p>im sure you probaly forgot but around this time youre cousin was visting you and you wouldnt come over and see me, which still doesnt make sense to me, shes grown you dont have to take care of her</p>
        <p>and it was this day that was the start of the longest weeks of me not seeing you</p>
    
        <h1>13th - 15th July 2023</h1>
        <p>This was the weekend you where at your grandfathers *cough*, yeah and i remember it was at night on the friday and we were talking over the phone i think you were still here in karen park, and when we were about to hang up the was a silence for a few seconds and you hung up, and then you texted saying you wanted to tell me how you love me, how much i mean to you, that you wanna spend the rest of your life with me</p>
        <!add picture here>
        <p>i was so loney this weekend:( </p>
        <p>i think that on this sunday it was the first time i said i love you, and i love you more now, i love you more and more everyday</p>
